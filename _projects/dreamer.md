## Safe RL (Nightmare Dreamer)
Nightmare Dreamer is a sample efficient, multi-agent approach to Safe RL.
We learn a world model including safety constraints and use the model to learn both a safe policy and a control policy and in a hierarchical fashion use the model to look ahead to determine which policy to use.
Our technique archives zero costs while maximizing rewards outperforming other model-free methods completely from image observation.

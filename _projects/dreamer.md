title: Nightmare Dreamer DREAMING ABOUT UNSAFE STATES AND PLANING AHEAD
description: We present Nightmare Dreamer, a sample efficient, multi-agent approach to Safe RL, we learn a world model including safety constraints and use the model to learn both a safe policy and a control policy and in a hierarchical fashion use the model to look ahead to determine which policy to use this. Our technique archives zero costs while maximising possible rewards outperforming other model-free methods completely from image observation.

## Nightmare Dreamer
We present Nightmare Dreamer, a sample efficient, multi-agent approach to Safe RL, we learn a world model including safety constraints and use the model to learn both a safe policy and a control policy and in a hierarchical fashion use the model to look ahead to determine which policy to use this. Our technique archives zero costs while maximising possible rewards outperforming other model-free methods completely from image observation.

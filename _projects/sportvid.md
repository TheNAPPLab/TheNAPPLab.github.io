## Pan-Tilt-Zoom Sports Videography

We are developing an autonomous videography system based on a collection
of pan-tilt-zoom cameras!
The goal of project is to detect and track a group of moving actors/athletes and
to control the cameras to autonomously film them from multiple perspectives in a
sports setting.

Our hope is to eventually deploy versions of this system at Mines sporting
events.
Because of that we try to involve student groups and undergraduates
extensively in development.

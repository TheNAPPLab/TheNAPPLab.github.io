title: Taskography - Evaluating robot task planning over large 3D scene graphs

notitle: false

description: |
  Taskography is the first large-scale robotic task planning benchmark over 3DSGs. While most benchmarking efforts in this area focus on vision-based planning, we systematically study symbolic planning, to decouple planning performance from visual representation learning.

title: f-Cal - Calibrated aleatoric uncertainty estimation from neural networks for robot perception

notitle: false

description: |
  f-Cal is calibration method proposed to calibrate probabilistic regression networks. Typical bayesian neural networks are shown to be overconfident in their predictions. To use the predictions for downstream tasks, reliable and calibrated uncertainity estimates are critical. f-Cal is a straightforward loss function, which can be employed to train any probabilistic neural regressor, and obtain calibrated uncertainty estimates.

## Working with NAPPLab!

We are always looking for students and researchers to join our team.

Before you reach out, we suggest reviewing our project pages and publication to
get a sense of what interests you.
While our lab is located in computer science, backgrounds of students in
our group can vary;
experience in engineering areas is also relevant, especially regarding projects
involving aerial robots, system integration, or control.

    GRADUATE STUDENTS:
    In addition to the MS and PhD thesis programs, there are a few other ways in
    which you can work with our group.
    Both CS and Robotics offer MS Project options; this is a slightly lighter
    option than a thesis and involves 6-credits of research over two semesters
    and a project report.
    Otherwise, see "ALL" below.
    </p>

    <p>
    UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS:
    The <i>SURF (summer) and MURF (semesters)</i> are some of the best
    mechanisms to get involved with research at Mines as an undergraduate, but
    these programs are selective so we recommend coordinating with Dr. Corah in
    advance to develop a strong application.
    Additionally, we can hire students on <i>work study</i> if you have that
    support via your financial aid package.
    We also occasionally supervise projects such via the <i>Field Session or
    Capstone</i> programs;
    feel free to reach out in advance to see if we are planning to supervise or
    sponsor a project when you will be taking the course.
    Also, see "ALL" below.
    </p>

    <p>
    ALL: In addition to the above,
    you may be able to work with us via an independent study,
    we often hire for hourly positions,
    or you may contribute or collaborate on an informal basis.
